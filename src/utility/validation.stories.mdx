# Form Validation

`@system76/forms` includes form validation for inputs. It uses `vee-validate`
behind the scenes, but exposes everything you should need in this package. There
are a couple of benefits to this. To start, we have rewritten all of the error
messages to match the default Elixir Ecto error messages. This ensures
consistency for the user and makes it impossible to tell if the error came from
client side validation, or the server.

One thing to keep in mind, we do not infer validation rules. _Everything_
(including attributes like `required`) should be given in the `validation` prop.
This ensures there is _one true way_ for validation and simplifies the
readability.

### Adding Rules

We only expose a small amount of very commonly used rules. If there are other
rules that are needed, you can open a PR to this package, or implement it where
you need it. To do so,
[look at the vee-validate docs](https://logaretm.github.io/vee-validate/guide/basics.html#adding-rules).

### Available Rules

These are the default rules that we have included in the package.
